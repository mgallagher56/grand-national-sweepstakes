# Slim Framework 3 Skeleton Application

Use this skeleton application to quickly setup and start working on a new Slim Framework 3 application. This application uses the latest Slim 3 with the PHP-View template renderer. It also uses the Monolog logger.

This skeleton application was built for Composer. This makes setting up a new Slim Framework application quick and easy.

## Install the Application

Create a new directory with your project name, e.g:
```
mkdir academyProject
```

Once inside the new directory, clone this repo:
```
git clone git@github.com:Mayden-Academy/slim3-skeleton.git .
```
One cloned, you must install the slim components by running:
```
composer install
```

To run the application locally:
```
composer start
```

Run this command in the application directory to run the test suite
```
composer test
```
That's it! Now go build something cool.
